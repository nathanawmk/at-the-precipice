Poetry

At the precipice, 
You find me there. 
During the dark night of the soul,
I saw Winston Churchill’s Black Dog
I have stared into Nietzsche’s Abyss. 
Metaphors are abstractions.
And abstractions are lies. 
Beyond the precipice I threw myself at
Where life ends and eternity begins. 
-Nathan Aw
